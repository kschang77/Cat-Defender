This is a simple JS/HTML5 Shmup base don Jared Mill's work. I turned the orientation to vertical,
changed the art a bit, and will continue to mess with it about multiple lives and scores. 

All PNG files used are obtained from public domain sources such as pdclipart.org 
or publicdomainfiles.com and are PD as far as I know. 

You can play it at https://kschang77.github.io/Cat-Defender/

Beware, it has a lot of problems with collision detection. And you only have one
life (instead of 3 or 9).
